# Pic2Words

This web application transcodes binary data with an assortment of English words. It allows you to convert images on the web to/from an array of words.

# Running

This web application was written in the [Go programming language](https://golang.org/doc/install). Once you have go, you can run it like this:

    go run server.go 8080

You may now connect to "http://localhost:8080" to access the web application.

# Live demo

Currently, a demo is running live at [words.aqnichol.com](http://words.aqnichol.com). I do not know how long I will keep it up, but for now you can check it out.
